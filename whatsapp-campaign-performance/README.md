# **WhatsApp Campaign Performance Analysis for Pharmaceutical Marketing**

WhatsApp is an important engagement channel in pharmaceutical marketing, enabling companies to reach healthcare professionals (HCPs) at scale across multiple medical specialties. However, campaign data is often delivered in raw operational formats, and reporting typically requires time-consuming manual work in Excel.

This project presents a repeatable workflow that converts WhatsApp campaign logs into business-ready performance insights. The notebook standardizes key funnel metrics (Sent, Delivered, Clicked), supports segmentation by specialty and ownership, and summarizes results in a reporting-friendly format.

Campaign performance is evaluated using delivery outcomes and click-based engagement as a conservative indicator of interaction. Undelivered messages are reviewed separately to provide operational context (including dominant failure reasons), helping stakeholders interpret results accurately. Overall, this approach reduces reporting time from hours to minutes and supports more focused targeting and campaign optimization.
