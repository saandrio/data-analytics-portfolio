# WhatsApp Campaign Performance Analysis for Pharmaceutical Marketing

WhatsApp has become an important engagement channel in pharmaceutical marketing, enabling companies to communicate directly with healthcare professionals (HCPs) at scale. Campaigns often involve sending thousands of messages across multiple medical specialties, making performance monitoring a critical but non-trivial task.

A common challenge for marketing and analytics teams is that WhatsApp campaign data is typically delivered in raw, operational formats. Generating performance reports often requires extensive manual processing in Excel, which is time-consuming, difficult to scale, and prone to inconsistency. At the same time, campaign effectiveness must be evaluated within a consent-compliant framework while still enabling meaningful segmentation to support better targeting decisions.

This project demonstrates an automated analytical workflow that transforms raw WhatsApp campaign logs into structured performance insights. By integrating campaign delivery data with an anonymized consent and master database, the analysis enables accurate measurement of delivery and engagement while ensuring alignment with consented contacts.

Key performance metrics such as delivery rate and open rate are evaluated and segmented by medical specialty and ownership, revealing engagement patterns that are not visible in aggregate results. Through this approach, campaign reporting time can be reduced from hours to minutes, while providing deeper, more actionable insights to support improved targeting and future campaign optimization.
